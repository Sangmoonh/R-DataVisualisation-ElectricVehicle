344,US,Vehicle Incremental Cost Allocation,"The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) must allocate the
incremental cost of purchasing alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) across
the entire fleet of vehicles distributed by GSA. This mandate also
applies to other federal agencies that procure vehicles for federal
fleets. For more information, see the GSA\'s

347,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for State and Alternative Fuel Provider Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, as amended, certain state
government and alternative fuel provider fleets are required to acquire
alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) as a portion of their annual light-duty
vehicle acquisitions. Compliance is required by fleets that operate,
lease, or control 50 or more light-duty vehicles within the United
States. Of those 50 vehicles, at least 20 must be used primarily within
a single Metropolitan Statistical Area/Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area, and those same 20 vehicles must also be capable of
being centrally fueled for the fleet to be subject to the regulatory
requirements.

Under [Standard
Compliance](https://epact.energy.gov/standard-compliance), the AFVs that
covered fleets acquire help them achieve compliance, with each AFV
acquired earning the fleet one AFV-acquisition credit. Covered fleets
may earn additional credits for AFVs earned in excess of their
requirements, and these credits may be banked for future use toward
compliance or traded with other fleets. Additionally, fleets that use
fuel blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) in medium- and
heavy-duty vehicles may earn credits toward their annual AFV-acquisition
requirements. A fleet may also earn credits that may be used toward
compliance or banked once the fleet achieves compliance for investments
in alternative fuel infrastructure, mobile non-road equipment, and
emerging technologies associated with certain electric drive vehicle
technologies.

Fleets may also opt into [Alternative
Compliance](https://epact.energy.gov/alternative-compliance), which
allows fleets the option to choose a petroleum reduction path in lieu of
acquiring AFVs under Standard Compliance. Interested fleets must obtain
from DOE a waiver from Standard Compliance by submitting a plan that
demonstrates a path by which they will achieve a certain level of
petroleum reduction specific to their fleet composition.

357,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for Federal Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, 75% of new light-duty
vehicles acquired by covered federal fleets must be alternative fuel
vehicles (AFVs). As amended in January 2008, Section 301 of EPAct 1992
expands the definition of AFVs to include hybrid electric vehicles, fuel
cell vehicles, and advanced lean burn vehicles. Fleets that use fuel
blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) may earn credits toward
their annual requirements. Federal fleets are also required to use
alternative fuels in dual-fuel vehicles unless the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) approves waivers for agency vehicles; grounds for a waiver
include lack of alternative fuel availability and unreasonable cost (per
EPAct 2005, section 701).

Additional requirements for federal fleets were included in the [Energy
Independence and Security Act of
2007](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/laws/eisa), such as fleet management
plans and petroleum reduction from 2005 levels (Section 142), low
greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting vehicle acquisition requirements (Section
141), and renewable fuel infrastructure installation requirements
(Section 246). For more information, see the [Federal Fleet
Management](https://federalfleets.energy.gov/) website.

To track progress toward meeting AFV acquisition and fuel use
requirements, federal fleets must report on their percent alternative
fuel increase compared to the fiscal year 2005 baseline, alternative
fuel use as a percentage of total fuel consumption, AFV acquisitions as
a percentage of vehicle acquisitions, and fleet-wide miles per gasoline
gallon equivalent of petroleum fuels.

Executive Order 13834, issued in May 2018, requires the Secretary of
Energy (Secretary), in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the
Administrator of General Services, and the heads of other agencies as
appropriate, to review the existing federal vehicle fleet requirements.
In April 2019, the Secretary provided a report to the Chairman of the
Council on Environmental Quality and the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget detailing opportunities to optimize federal fleet
performance, reduce associated costs, and streamline reporting and
compliance requirements. Specifically, the report recommends that
federal agencies identify and implement strategies to:

-   Right-size the fleet
-   Reduce vehicle miles traveled
-   Implement more fuel efficient vehicles
-   Align the implementation of AFVs and associated fueling
    infrastructure

Executive Order 14008, issued in January 2021, requires the Chair of the
Council on Environmental Quality, the Administrator of General Services,
and the Director of the Office and Management and Budget, in
coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the
Secretary, and the heads of other relevant agencies, to assist the
National Climate Advisor in developing a comprehensive plan to
facilitate clean and zero-emission vehicles for federal, state, local,
and tribal government fleets, including vehicles of the U.S. Postal
Service. The plan must be submitted to the National Climate Task Force
by April 27, 2021.

358,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for Private and Local Government Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) was directed to determine whether private and local
government fleets should be mandated to acquire alternative fuel
vehicles (AFVs). In January 2004, DOE published a final rule announcing
its decision not to implement an AFV acquisition mandate for private and
local government fleets. In response to a March 2006 ruling by a U.S.
District Court, DOE issued a subsequent final rulemaking on the new
Replacement Fuel Goal in March 2007, which extended the EPAct 1992 goal
to 2030. The goal is to achieve a domestic production capacity for
replacement fuels sufficient to replace 30% of the U.S. motor fuel
consumption. In March 2008, DOE issued its determination not to
implement a fleet compliance mandate for private and local government
fleets, concluding that such a mandate is not necessary to achieve the
Replacement Fuel Goal. For more information on the Private and Local
Government Fleet Rule compliance, visit the [EPAct Private and Local

kilowatt-hours. States are also allowed to establish programs allowing
low-emission and energy-efficient vehicles to pay a toll to access HOV
lanes.

Vehicles must be certified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) and appropriately labeled for use in HOV lanes. The U.S.
Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for planning and
implementing HOV programs, including the low-emission and
energy-efficient vehicle criteria EPA established. States that choose to
adopt these requirements will be responsible for enforcement and vehicle
labeling. The HOV exemption for AFVs and EVs expires September 30, 2025
and low-emission and energy-efficient vehicle toll-access to HOV lanes
expired September 30, 2019.

4249,CA,Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Production Requirements,"The California Air Resources Board (CARB) certifies new passenger cars,
light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles as ZEVs if the
vehicles produce zero exhaust emissions of any criteria pollutant (or
precursor pollutant) under all possible operational modes and
conditions. Manufacturers with annual sales between 4,501 and 60,000
vehicles may comply with the ZEV requirements through multiple
alternative compliance options that include producing low emission
vehicles and obtaining ZEV credits. Manufacturers with annual sales of
4,500 vehicles or less are not subject to this regulation.

CARB's emissions control program for model year (MY) 2017 through 2025
combines the control of smog, soot, and greenhouse gases (GHGs) and
requirements for ZEVs into a single package of standards called Advanced
Clean Cars (ACC). In December 2012, CARB finalized new regulatory
requirements that allow vehicle manufacturer compliance with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) GHG requirements for MY 2017
through 2025 to serve as compliance with California's adopted GHG
emissions requirements for those same model years.

The accounting procedures for MY 2018 through 2025 are based on a credit
system as shown in the table below. The minimum ZEV requirement for each
manufacturer includes the percentage of passenger cars and light-duty
trucks produced by the manufacturer and delivered for sale in
California. The regulation also includes opportunities for compliance
with transitional ZEVs, which must demonstrate certain exhaust emissions
standards, evaporative emissions standards, on-board diagnostic
requirements, and extended warranties.

6493,CA,Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Standards,"California's LEV II exhaust emissions standards apply to Model Year (MY)
2004 and subsequent model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and
medium-duty passenger vehicles meeting specified exhaust standards. The
LEV II standards represent the maximum exhaust emissions for LEVs, Ultra
LEVs, and Super Ultra LEVs, including flexible fuel, bi-fuel, and
dual-fuel vehicles when operating on an alternative fuel. MY 2009 and
subsequent model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty
passenger vehicles must meet specified fleet average greenhouse gas
(GHG) exhaust emissions requirements. Each manufacturer must comply with
these fleet average GHG requirements, which are based on California Air
Resources Board (CARB) calculations. Bi-fuel, flexible fuel, dual-fuel,
and grid-connected hybrid electric vehicles may be eligible for an
alternative compliance method.

In December 2012, CARB finalized regulatory requirements, referred to as
LEV III, which allow vehicle manufacturer compliance with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's GHG requirements for MY 2017-2025 to
serve as compliance with California's adopted GHG emissions requirements
for those same model years.

In November 2022, CARB approved LEV IV standards, which updates
regulations for light- and medium-duty internal combustion engine
vehicles by reducing allowable exhaust emissions and emissions caused by
evaporation. LEV IV also changes the calculation procedure for new
vehicle fleet-average emissions and prohibits zero emissions vehicles
from being considered in fleet-average emissions calculations by MY
2029.

(RFN)](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/alternative_fuel_corridors/nominations/2023_request_for_nominations_r7.pdf),
state and local officials must submit nominations to FHWA by June 21,
2023. State and local agencies may nominate additional corridors, extend
currently designated corridors, nominate another fuel along an already
designated corridor, and update the status of previously designated
corridors.

The Round 7 RFN and AFC designation is tied to funding eligibility under
the [NEVI Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure
Discretionary Grant Program](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/12744). The
FHWA encourages nominations that focus on EV charging infrastructure
along Interstate corridors, but nominations may also be submitted
elsewhere on the National Highway System. Corridor projects along Round
7 AFCs are not eligible for the [2023 Notice of Funding Opportunity for
the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant
Program](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/12732), which closes June 13,
2023. When considering Round 7 nominations, FHWA strongly encourages
segments of Interstates that do not currently have an EV designation,
particularly longer Interstate segments that provide important through
connectivity to adjoining States.

FHWA is also requesting input on proposed Freight EV Corridors
designation, outlined in the Round 7 RFN.

FHWA must update and redesignate corridors periodically thereafter. For
more information, including FHWA areas of interest for corridor
designations and infrastructure development, see the FHWA

2018-2021. Building on the 2014 Action Plan, the 2018 Action Plan makes
recommendations for states and other key partners in five priority
areas:

-   Raising consumer awareness and interest in electric vehicle
    technology;
-   Building out a reliable and convenient residential, workplace and

each state must report on the number of registered ZEVs, the number of
public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and hydrogen fueling
stations, and available information regarding workplace fueling for
ZEVs.

In June 2018, the Task Force published a new [ZEV Action
Plan](https://www.nescaum.org/documents/2018-zev-action-plan.pdf) for
2018-2021. Building on the 2014 Action Plan, the 2018 Action Plan makes
recommendations for states and other key partners in five priority
areas:

-   Raising consumer awareness and interest in electric vehicle
    technology;
-   Building out a reliable and convenient residential, workplace and
    public charging/fueling infrastructure network;
-   Continuing and improving access to consumer purchase and
    non-financial incentives;
-   Expanding public and private sector fleet adoption; and
-   Supporting dealership efforts to increase ZEV sales.
